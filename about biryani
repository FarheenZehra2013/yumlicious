our 

Mouth watering speciality is hyderabadi Biryani is infact a very carefully considered and proportionate

 blend of finest quality of ingredients, such as, Basmati rice, meat of young male sheeps, 
 along with a variety of aromatic spices, vegs, yoghurt, etc and even fire and flame required to be tactfully maintained.
 Trust me, it’s not the meat that bears the sole focus but the aroma of the saffron-flavored rice and the spices that
 have done a bulk of the job in perfecting the Biryani over the years. 


This chicken curry gets a lot of flavor from the addition of garlic, ginger, cumin, and other spices. 
And then there are the chilies. We add in a combination of fresh green chilies and dry red chilies and chili powder to give flavor and spiciness to this dish.
 If you’re not a spice lover, you can always adjust the amount of green chilies if you prefer a milder heat.

Read more at Curious Cuisiniere: Chicken Karahi / Kadai Chicken (Pakistani Chicken Curry) https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/chicken-karahi-pakistani-chicken-curry/Chicken Karahi (also known as Kadai) is a Northern Indian/ Pakistani dish that is made in a wok.

  It typically has a high amount of ginger and in the Indian recipes will use bell peppers as a unique flavor component.  It’s not the same as Chicken Jalfrezi, which is more of a fusion of Chinese-Indian and typically is a drier curry than Karahi.

This is an excellent curry that is definitely going to be one of my routine in the arsenal.  It’s full of flavor and goes perfect with basmati rice or naan bread.  I get my naan either at Trader Joes or the Indian market where they sell it frozen.  I reheat it in a skillet and usually top it with a little melted butter or ghee.
