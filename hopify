why you are interested in shopify
I am very impressed with Shopifyâ€™s profile, growth history and work environment 
and very
 keen on growing myself with this organization. I am impressed how quickly this organization 
 has grown from single store to currently a host of over 1 million businesses.

Shopify is rated as one of best employers in Canada and have stellar reviews from existing
 and ex-employs on different forums. At this stage of my career,I believe, having a great 
 supporting employer will only impact positively on my professional career and journey.

In addition, having worked as Amazon seller, I have natural inclination towards e-commerce
 business and I enjoy working on different aspects of e-commerce business. This will make me a 
 natural fit for shopify organization and will help me in understanding a bigger picture. 
 

I applied online, met up with my recruiter in-person for a quick chat about my experiences and what I enjoyed the most about technology, and she told me a bit about the intern program at Shopify. Then I did two more online interviews with software developers and team leads. Both were very targeted towards my resume and previous programming experience (programming competitions, hackathons, personal side projects).
